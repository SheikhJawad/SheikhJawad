👋 Hi, I'm Jawad, a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in Frontend and Backend development using Django.

💼 With a strong passion for creating interactive and user-friendly web applications, I have experience in developing robust and scalable solutions. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into reality through clean and efficient code.

🌐 My expertise lies in building responsive and dynamic frontend interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bootstrap. I have a keen eye for design and strive to create visually appealing and intuitive user experiences.

💻 On the backend, I am proficient in Django, a powerful Python web framework. I leverage Django's versatility to develop server-side logic, handle data manipulation, and build RESTful APIs for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

🚀 I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving web development landscape.

🌟 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me. I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations.
